# Batch Processing Using Spring boot
![alt text](https://github.com/roulupen/spring-batch-demo/blob/master/SpringBatch%20Architecture.JPG?raw=true)

## This demo uses in memory H2 database for tracking the batch details and as part of batch processing it reads a CSV file present in resource directory and saves the content into the H2 database.

*** NOTE: The CSV file path is absolute if anyone copying this code for testing need to change the file path in application.properties.
